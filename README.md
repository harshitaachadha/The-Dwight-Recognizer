# The-Dwight-Recognizer
So this is basically supposed to be a mini project to create a deep learning model that recognizes an image of Dwight Scrute when it is fed one. The repository has a .csv file with the images' URL downloaded from google images. Now When I was trying to do this URL scaping, I observed that a lot of the tutorials online where no longer working. So I have also included a notebook with scraping instructions that have step by step instructions about how to go about scarping and downloading the imags in the image folder of the Jupyter labs environment.
